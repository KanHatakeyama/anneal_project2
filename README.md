# Usage
- You can run jupyter notebook codes for the demo codes

# Notes
- Custom REINVENT module is included in this project. (https://github.com/MarcusOlivecrona/REINVENT)
- In the paper, Fujitsu digital annealer is used for annealing.
- The annealer is not currently open for public. Therefore, CPU-based modules are used the demos instead.
