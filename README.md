# Molecule generation by supervised/unsupervised machine learning and quantum-inspired annealing
-Codes for [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/62575b815b9009f6750d41bd)

# Usage
- You can run jupyter notebook codes for the demo codes

# Notes
- Custom REINVENT module is included in this project. (https://github.com/MarcusOlivecrona/REINVENT)
- In the paper, Fujitsu digital annealer is used for annealing.
- The annealer is not currently open for public. Therefore, CPU-based modules are used the demos instead.
